# TypeScript Issues to Resolve

This document outlines TypeScript issues encountered during Phase 3 implementation that need to be addressed in future phases.

## Import.meta Issues

Several files have errors related to the usage of `import.meta.env`:

```
The 'import.meta' meta-property is only allowed when the '--module' option is 'es2020', 'es2022', 'esnext', 'system', 'node16', or 'nodenext'.
```

### Affected Files:
- src/lib/db/index.ts
- src/services/email/index.ts
- src/services/analytics/index.ts
- src/services/api-client.ts

### Solution:
Update the TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.app.json` to include:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "target": "es2020"
  }
}
```

## Repository Pattern Implementation

The generic repository pattern in `src/lib/db/repository.ts` has several TypeScript errors related to the generic type handling. This is due to the complexity of the Drizzle ORM type system.

### Solution:
Refactor the repository pattern to use a more specific approach for each entity type, or enhance the type definitions to better accommodate Drizzle's types.

## Module Resolution Issues

Some imports are not being resolved correctly:

```
Cannot find module 'hono/preset/env' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

### Solution:
1. Install missing type declarations
2. Update the module resolution strategy in `tsconfig.json`
3. Consider using path aliases for cleaner imports

## Next Steps

These issues should be addressed as part of Phase 5 (Environment Configuration) or as an additional task in Phase 4. Resolving these TypeScript issues will improve the developer experience and catch potential errors at compile time rather than runtime.
