## Role Structure

The application now has a clear role hierarchy:

1. **Superadmin**
   - Full system access
   - System configuration
   - User management
   - Impersonation capabilities

2. **Admin**
   - Administrative access
   - User management
   - Settings management
   - Team and project management

3. **Manager**
   - Team management
   - Project management
   - Calendar management
   - Limited administrative capabilities

4. **User**
   - Basic access
   - Personal profile and settings
   - View assigned projects
   - Personal calendar

## Testing Instructions

To test the authentication system:

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Use the quick login buttons to test each role:
   - Superadmin: superadmin@example.com / superadmin123
   - Admin: admin@example.com / admin123
   - Manager: manager@example.com / manager123
   - User: user@example.com / user123

3. Verify that each role is redirected to the appropriate dashboard
4. Verify that each role has the correct permissions and access

## Next Steps

- Implement proper backend authentication when ready
- Add more granular permission checks for specific features
- Consider implementing a role-based menu system
- Add audit logging for authentication events
